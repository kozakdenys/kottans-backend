## Git

These were really cool courses. I have never used the `git log` command, I preferred to use IDE features to review history. But It is really powerful tool.

Also, now I feel confident to use `git rebase` and `git cherry-pick` commands.

## Unix Shell

I have found a lot of commands I have never known before:  `more`, `cat`, `man`, `ps`, `kill`. I will definitely use them in the future.
